VIM settings
------------
My personal portable VIM settings. For use with Vim7 and up.


Mac users
---------
On MacOSx there is a custom VI for Mac install. (On most systems installed by default.) 
Edit .vimrc in /usr/share/vim to make settings global for all users

*edit* 
Damn you folks at Apple. During upgrade to Mountain Lion, the 'old' .vimrc settings are being removed (and vi as a whole), without notice.
On the other side, they finally have a proper VI version installed now. Create the .vimrc in your profile home to fix.
